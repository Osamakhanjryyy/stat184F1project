This study explores the fierce rivalry between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton during the 2021 Formula 1 championship. By use of race-by-race performances, points lines, and consistency, we reviewed key incidents and trends comprising the championship. Our study revealed that Verstappen's slightly greater consistency in securing victories edged the odds against Hamilton, although Hamilton registered more podiums overall.
